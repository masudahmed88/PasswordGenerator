# PasswordGenerator

created the var for the 4 different type of characters also created a var for the combination(allChoices) of all the characters


then created a var called "character" for the password that displays in the textarea after the user specifies all selections.

Created a function for the generation of the password. Then created a conditional statement which forces the user to select a number
between 8 and 128. 

Then i created the confirmation message depending on user selection. Then created the conditional statments. Then i created a conditional 
statement which factors in if the user rejects all character options. 

Then I created a loop that randomizes the characters chosen by the user. 

Then i scripted the generation of the password into the password field, and finally created the eventlistener to display the password.
